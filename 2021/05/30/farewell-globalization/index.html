      <p>To solve the <em>Climate Crisis</em> increasing economic productivity and energy efficiency
is not sufficient.
Absolute <em>decoupling</em> of economic growth and environmental degradition, including
global warming is not feasible (Hickel and Kallis (2019) Is Green Growth Possible?).
We will have to <strong>stop economic growth itself</strong> or even <strong>degrow</strong>  on a global scale.</p>

<p>Growth economists has always had models that in the long run ends in a <em>steady state</em>.
That&rsquo;s just mathematics.
Many economists have been thinking about &lsquo;steady state economics&rsquo; for a long time.
Wikipedia has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steady-state_economy">overview</a>.</p>

<p>Most recent a new label has been introduced: <a href="https://doughnuteconomics.org/about-doughnut-economics">&lsquo;Doughnut Economy&rsquo;</a>.
The focus is on defining the <em>limits</em> within which the economy can operate without harming
the environment on the one side and providing for a good life for everybody on the other side.
Also focused is the new <em>practises</em> people and businesses can apply in developing
sustainablity principles - moving from &lsquo;exstractive&rsquo; to &lsquo;generative&rsquo; enterprises.</p>

<p>This is the optimistic bottom-up movement of buidling new practises - and is certainly important.</p>

<p>The other side of the coin is more pessimistic:</p>

<p>The world today consists also of the dark side: environmentally
harmfull &lsquo;practises&rsquo; on a large scale that has to be removed, and removed quickly.
These harmful practises contains the &lsquo;normal&rsquo;, &lsquo;business as usual&rsquo; way of operating
for businesses and working people all over the world.
The really hard task ahead is to knock down these practises.</p>

<p>So, implementing a steady state (or degrowth) economy <strong>now</strong> - due to the
climate urgency &lsquo; is quite another issue than small-scale development of &lsquo;doughnut economics&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Herman Daly&rsquo;s famous book “A Steady-State Economy,” includes a 10-point
<em>Transition to a Steady State Economy (SSE)</em>-program.</p>

<p>Point 5 on the list is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Re-regulate international commerce—move away from free trade, free capital mobility and globalization, adopt compensating tariffs to protect efficient national policies of cost internalization from standards-lowering competition from other countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just this one point is a very tall order.
Actually, the task ahead is to <strong>undo all achievements of the liberal economic order that
has steered the world in recent decades</strong></p>

<p>How can it be done?</p>

      <p>Some Time Soon - things will be the same, but different.</p>
<p>However, we did not notice the emerging change? - or did we?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>David Roberts tweet the day after the Trump-mob storm on Capitol:
Feels like we&rsquo;re trapped in a script, a play,
that has been performed several times around the world recently.
And even though we know exactly how the fall-of-democracy script plays
out &ndash; every beat, every chapter &ndash; we&rsquo;re just trapped, helpless,
watching it play out</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2018 Matthew Stewart had an excellent
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-birth-of-a-new-american-aristocracy/559130/">piece</a>
in the Atlantic on the morphing of the upper 9.9 percent of American wealth-distribution
into a new <em>Aristocracy</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the best evidence for the power of an aristocracy is
the degree of resentment it provokes (Matthew Stewart)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump is a smart entrepreneur - first in business, then in politics.
Before other he saw the vote potential in the resentment against this new aristocracy -
The Washington Swamp.</p>
<p>Trump succeeded in creating a bizarre aliance between ultra-rich
and the left-behinds of the neoliberal era -
picking up enough votes to start an attack on the ruling aristocracy.</p>
<p>230 years have gone since the French Revolution -
and we still have not seen the return of the pitchforks.</p>
<p>Obama sold &lsquo;change&rsquo; without delivering.
Trump makes &lsquo;change&rsquo;, but only for the benefit of the ultra-rich.
His attacks on the aristocracy in Washington is enough to get him going
with the resentfull.</p>
<p>The aristocracy managed to overturn their 2016-loss with at call
for &lsquo;healing of the nation&rsquo;.
But how should this healing occur?
Only removal of the aristocracy will satisfy the resentfull.
That will not happen witouth the pitchforks.
Some time soon  there is worse to come.</p>
